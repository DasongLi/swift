# the target of my code.
For swift does not have some prime structures, I try to write something.

# Introduction
 * Stack and Queue are the structures with template.
 * priority_queue is min heap
 
# About citing 
everyone can download my code and does not have to say about the citing from here. I just wish swift is better and better.
 
# future
I will update my structure by using extend method in the future.
In my view, swift is so powerful that I want to get the hang of it and make it more greater.
