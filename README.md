# swift

# For swift does not have some prime structures, I try to write something.

 * Stack and Queue are the structures with template.
 * priority_queue is min heap
 
# I will update my structure by using extend method in the future.

# In my view, swift is so powerful that I want to get the hang of it and make it more greater.
