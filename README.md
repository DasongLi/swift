# Target of my code.
For swift does not have some prime structures, I try to write something.

# Introduction
 * Stack and Queue are the structures with template.
 * priority_queue is min heap just for Int. But it is easy to change other types.
 
# About citing 
 * everyone can download my code and does not have to say about the citing from here.
 * It is my pleasure to see my code is reused by others.
 * I just wish swift is better and better.
